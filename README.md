# DNN-Model-for-Chemical-Kinetics

This is the repo for the DNN model used in the hydrogen/air chemical kinetic predictions. The details can be found in our peer-reviewed paper [1]. The Python and Fortran version test codes of auto-ignition are attached.

Please let me know if you are interested in the collaboration or have any question regarding the model.
